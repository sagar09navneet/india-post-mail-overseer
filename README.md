# Standard Questionnaire PWA for India Post Patiala

## Overview

This project aims to streamline the process of quarterly visits to Branch Post Offices by Mail Overseers under India Post Patiala. The existing process involves filling out paper forms which are time-consuming to submit and manage. Additionally, the analysis of the collected data takes considerable effort. To address these challenges, we have developed a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows Mail Overseers to fill out the questionnaire digitally and generates PDF reports automatically. The application also includes a dashboard for administrators to track the progress of Mail Overseers.

## Features

- Digital questionnaire form based on the standard requirements for quarterly visits to Branch Post Offices.
- User-friendly interface designed for easy data entry and submission.
- Automated PDF report generation for submission to the head office.
- Dashboard for administrators to monitor Mail Overseers' activities, including the number of inspections conducted and their adherence to deadlines.
